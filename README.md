# Example Navbar

This is a simple React/Vite project to demonstrate a Navbar created for students of Shecodes Plus Brisbane 2023 for their crowdfunding project.

[Adapted from the MakeUseOf example here](https://www.makeuseof.com/responsive-navigation-bar-using-html-and-css/)

I've used google fonts here, a gradient background for the nav, and there are some extra (non-functional) links in the 'services' link as an example.
Feel free to clone it and make whatever adjustments you want!

Disclaimer - I made/adapted this super quickly from the example above so there might be some issues, it's intended as just a simple example for you to be able to adapt into your crowdfunding projects. You could probably make something a little smoother than this if you want to spend the time.

To run, simply:

- [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repo (take note where you are cloning it to on your local system!)
- you can clone via github desktop, or via terminal command e.g. `C:\users\myname\shecodesstuff\ git clone git@github.com:alikillen/shecodes-crowdfunding-navbar-example.git`
- navigate inside the cloned repo folder in your terminal `cd shecodes-crowdfunding-navbar-example`
- run `npm run dev`
- open the site on your browser localhost at the suggested port.
